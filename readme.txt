command1:  make -f Makefile.mk main
command2: ./main

I was making decent progress until yesterday; at that point in time all attempts at progress where halted due to personal reasons.

This is being submitted because it's better than nothing.

In main.cpp you can see various tests; comment out all but the one you want to see.

I'm aware this doesn't fit the project requirements.  This is what I could get done.
